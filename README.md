A) Use random and fix the number of holes and created too many variable. The probability method reduces variables and flexibility of the number of holes

B) Use the If-else method is confusing but the switch method is better (Forgotten about this method )

C) Concept of movement and hitting the hole and hat is tabulated but unable to write it in a systematic. Initially created too many variables for if else for comparison and unable to add up the position of x and y. Have to do it a step at a time

D) The Out Bound works well for the col when the variable is negative but for row it gave been outcome. Unable to understand the syntax error below as all are written on the same comparison statement with same logic. Need further advise on this


Your position is at row -1 and col 0
Your position is at row 10 and col 8
